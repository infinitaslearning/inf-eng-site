Infinitas Learning is pleased to announce that Taco Morelisse will be joining Infinitas as new Chief Executive Officer effective end of December 2018.

As Infinitas continues to lead the education markets in The Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden, Taco Morelisse brings a wealth of experience in content publishing. Furthermore, his experience in digital transformation fits well with the leading role Infinitas has in the evolution of digital learning materials and personalised & adaptive learning.
Taco has previously been CEO of Kluwer, where he oversaw the successful transformation from a folio-based business to a principally digital business. More recently, Taco has been COO of Travix, a global online travel company.

Taco about the appointment: “I have known and followed the Infinitas business for many years. Indeed, as a child, I was educated in Holland and benefited from many of the high-quality products that the Dutch subsidiary Noordhoff delivers. I am very excited about my new appointment as I believe that Infinitas is uniquely positioned to continue to deliver high quality, truly innovative digital and folio products to its customers”.

The Company would like to thank José Duarte for his contribution to the development of the company’s strategy and wishes him well in his future endeavours.
